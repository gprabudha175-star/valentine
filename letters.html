We fight sometimes…
late nights 🌙, small misunderstandings,
little silences between messages that feel heavier than words 💭.

But no matter what happens,
one thing never changes 🤍.

We still say —
“Good night 🌙”
“Take care 🤍”
“Sweet dreams 😴✨”

आणि हेच मला सगळं सांगून जातं…
that even in chaos, even in confusion,
you always choose care 💗.

You are busy in college —
running between lectures 📚, events 🎉, responsibilities,
handling so much more than people realise.

And still…
whenever you get even one small moment,
you text me 💬,
you call me 📞,
you check on me 🤍.

That effort… 💞
that quiet consistency…
it means more to me than long conversations or big promises 🌸.

And this…
this is what your love looks like to me,
even without you ever saying it 💞.

Most of the time,
the mistakes are mine.

I know that.
I accept that.

You handle things with so much maturity…
like a wise person 🕊️,
while many times I react emotionally.

Sometimes I behave wrongly.
Sometimes I think only from my side.

कधी कधी मी थोडा selfish होतो…
कधी possessive…
कधी jealous…
कधी insecure 😔.

When I get hurt or angry,
I try to avoid you,
I keep distance from you 💔.

But inside my mind,
another fear keeps growing…

What if you think
I’m not interested in you anymore?
What if you feel
I was just doing time pass with you?

But please believe me… 🙏
none of that is true.

I am always interested in you ❤️.
I have never done time pass with you.
This is not attraction.
This is my love for you 💖.

Whatever I do,
I do it out of care,
out of concern,
out of love for you 🌷.

If ever I spoke to you rudely…
if my words hurt you in anger or rage…
please forgive me 🫶.

I am still learning.
Still growing.
Still trying to become better — for you.

And one thing I am sure about…

Whenever life asks me to choose,
I will always choose you 🤍.

I will always be there with you.
No matter what.
No matter when.

I promise you…
I love you.
I love you so much ❤️✨.`,

                `Every morning starts with “Good morning ☀️”,
and somehow my day already feels lighter.

You call me Adi…
and that one word carries warmth, comfort,
and a sense of closeness I can’t explain 🫶.

We are not in a relationship —
and still, the bond we share feels deeper than many labels.

You trust me.
And that trust… 🤍
it’s something I value more than anything.

तू माझ्यावर इतका शांतपणे विश्वास ठेवतेस,
इतका सहज…
without doubts, without questions.

I know I matter to you.
I know my presence means something to you.
And that feeling…
it makes me feel important in a way words can’t describe.

You give me priority —
not because you have to,
but because you choose to.

When I’m low, you notice.
When I overthink, you understand.
When I speak badly about myself,
you stop me immediately and say —

“काही पण उगाच फालतूचं बोलू नकोस नाहीतर मला येऊन तुला द्यावं लागेल 😌💢”

And suddenly…
I feel cared for.
I feel protected 🤍.

You listen to me patiently.
You remember small things about me.
You make time for me, even when you barely have time for yourself 🌸.

I know you are sensitive.
I know you feel deeply.
And I promise…
I will always handle your heart with care 🤍.

In your life, I am your closest,
your best male friend.
And I respect that space completely.

But in my heart…
you are someone I’ll always choose.
Someone I’ll always stand by.

No matter what changes around us,
this connection —
this understanding —
will always stay special to me 💞.`,

                `Our video calls… 📱💞

Sometimes we talk.
Sometimes we don’t.

Sometimes we just look at each other…
and smile 😊.

No words.
No explanations.
Just you and me,
existing in the same moment 🤍.

We don’t need to fill the silence.
Because that silence feels safe.
It feels warm.
It feels like home 🏡✨.

Your cute reactions…
the way your expressions change,
the sparkle in your eyes when you smile 💫—
those little moments stay with me for a long time.

You don’t even realise it,
but your smile calms me.
Your presence makes things lighter 🌸.

कधी कधी आपण काहीच बोलत नाही,
तरी सगळं बोलून जातं…
that kind of comfort is rare.

You listen more than you speak.
You feel deeply, even quietly.
And that softness in you
is one of the things I admire the most 🤍.

In those video calls,
when the world feels too loud,
you become my peace.

No drama.
No pretence.
Just two hearts understanding each other 💗.

And honestly…
those silent smiles mean more to me
than a thousand words ever could ✨.`,

                `I don’t know what the future holds.
I don’t know what name time will give to us.

But I know one thing for sure…

You are my comfort 🤍.
You are my habit.
You are the calm I look for after a long day 🌙.

In my heart,
you are not just a crush.
You are not just someone special.

You are someone I respect deeply.
Someone I trust completely.
Someone I care about with all honesty 💖.

तू माझ्यासाठी फक्त एक व्यक्ती नाहीस…
तू माझ्या आयुष्यातला एक खूप महत्त्वाचा भाग आहेस.

Today, you see me as your closest,
your best male friend —
and I respect that, truly.

I never want to rush you.
I never want to pressure you.
All I want is to be there for you —
with patience, understanding, and care 🤍.

If someday life asks me to choose,
there will be no confusion in my heart.

I will choose you.
Every time.
Without hesitation.

I will stand with you.
I will support you.
I will protect your trust 🌸.

No matter where life takes us,
know this…

You are deeply valued.
You are genuinely cared for.
And you will never be alone 💞.

—
Always yours,
with all my heart — Prabudha ❤️`
